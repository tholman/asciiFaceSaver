# Ascii Faces Screen Saver

### About

This is a little osx screen saver (built with swift), that cylcles through some awesome ascii faces. Makes for a clean fun screen-savery experience.

### Installing

You can download the [latest release](https://github.com/tholman/asciiFaceSaver/releases). This is unsigned*, so here's a little [guide for the install](http://simplicitybliss.com/blog/shortcut-to-install-unsigned-applications-on-os-x)

### Checking out

Feel free to check out the app and code around... I have a small fear that some files may be missing to set up the project (although it works fine for me). Don't hesitate to reach out if I can help, or clean things up if you notice them out of order. It probably not hard to tell that I'm not an osx kind of guy.

### Adding a face

I'm totally happy with people contributing their own faces, here's a little wrap up of the steps involved!

1. Check that the face doesn't exist. (cmd + f)
2. Add your face in `asciiFaceManager.swift`
3. Build, and confirm that the face renders nicely.
4. Commit, and include ascii face in the commit message, eg: `add: (ง'̀-'́)ง`
5. Create pull request, include the face in that as well, just like the commit message.

Awesome! I'll merge it in, and create a new build.

### To Do

Sadly, I couldn't quite get the config screen to work, allowing you to change between light and dark themes, so its just stuck in dark for now. (still looks great!)

### Notes

* This is unsigned, I can't justify buying a developer licence for just this.
* Special cheers to [Max Ogden](https://github.com/maxogden/cool-ascii-faces) for his awesome contributions to the world of ascii faces ;)
